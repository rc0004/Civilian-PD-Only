# Version 1.0 Point Defence Slots Only on Civilian Ships

## Requirements

ModLauncher v1.2.1, which can be downloaded here -- https://github.com/DW2MC/DW2ModLoader/releases/tag/v1.2.1

## What does this mod do?

### It changes the size of every single weapons slot on civilian ships, changing them all to size 13. At that size, no weapons can be equipped, but the ship can still equip most point defence options. This takes place at the very start of a game, so all the auto-designs on your civ ships will not have a weapon at the start of a game, because there will be no weapons that are small enough to fit in the slot.


## Installation
1. Go to your Distant Worlds 2 installation, and navigate to the mods folder which will be in the main directory. This folder will have been included in the ModLauncher files. If this is not present, be sure to open up the ModLauncher zip files and bring the mods folder into your installation directory.

2. Either place the Civilian-PD-Only.zip into the mods folder, right click and select Extract Here. Or extract the zip files and manually choose the directory to place the unzipped files into - this needs to be in the mods folder, and be in its own folder named Civilian-PD-Only.

3. Make sure to keep the YAML files within the Civilian-PD-Only/data folder.
