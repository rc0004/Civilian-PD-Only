#Ideally shouldn't use ShipHullId to find ships, as each race has their own shiphullid to refer to the same type of ship, e.g. small freighter or medium freighter

#Can try to find ships to affect by searching for Role, e.g.
#<Role>FreighterMedium</Role

#Need to do for the following

#FreighterSmall
#FreighterMedium
#FreighterLarge
#ExplorationShip
#MiningShip

#Need to change following data
#        <ComponentBayId>0</ComponentBayId>
#        <Type>Weapon</Type>
#        <MaximumComponentSize>19</MaximumComponentSize>



##ComponentBayId 0 is always weapon
#<ComponentBayId>0</ComponentBayId>
#or txt(def.Role) is "FreighterMedium" or txt(def.Role) is "FreighterLarge" or txt(def.Role) is "ExplorationShip" or txt(def.Role) is "MiningShip":
ShipHull:
  - update-all:
